                <h3>FACEBOOK</h3>
                <p>Facebook is mostly where we can see anyone about them. They use it to update publicly. Some business owners use this platform to increase their customers and sales. Facebook is always used to connect on your family, friends and loved ones. We can see updates from them by looking at their Facebook profiles.</p>

                <h3>YOUTUBE</h3>
                <p>YouTube is where we can watch different content videos. What I like about YouTube is itï¿½s free to use. We don't have to pay just to watch something (unless you want it to be in YouTube Premium). It is also an easy way to share and learn information especially on times like this. Students are having difficulties in learning nowadays since they consider face-to-face learning, using YouTube helps them to know more about the lesson..</p>
